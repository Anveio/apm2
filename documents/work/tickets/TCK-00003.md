# Ticket: TCK-00003 — Implement hash-chain and signature primitives

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00003
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL, DOMAIN_SECURITY
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Implement Blake3 hashing for events
- Implement Ed25519 signing and verification
- Create KeyManager for key storage
- Implement hash-chain linking
- Implement signature verification

Out of scope:
- Key rotation (TCK-00004 dependency for projections)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0006
- REQ-1004

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0004
- EVID-1004

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0004
- EVID-1004

Criteria:
- Events are hashed with Blake3
- Events are signed with Ed25519
- Hash chain links to previous event
- Signature verification detects tampering
- Key storage with 0600 permissions

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
