# Ticket: TCK-00009 — Implement policy DSL parser

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00009
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL, DOMAIN_SECURITY
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Define policy YAML schema
- Parse policy files with serde_yaml
- Validate policy structure
- Load policy at startup
- Emit PolicyLoaded event

Out of scope:
- Rule evaluation (TCK-00010)
- Hot reload (future enhancement)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0004
- REQ-0005

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0003

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0003

Criteria:
- Policy YAML schema documented
- Parser handles all rule types
- Invalid policies rejected with clear errors
- PolicyLoaded event includes hash
- Example policy files created

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
