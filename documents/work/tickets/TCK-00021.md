# Ticket: TCK-00021 — Implement black-box adapter (observation-based)

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00021
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Spawn agent process
- Monitor filesystem for changes
- Detect tool requests from side effects
- Emit normalized events

Out of scope:
- Vendor-specific parsing (generic observer)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0010

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0001

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0001

Criteria:
- Agent process spawned with correct environment
- Filesystem changes detected
- Progress signals derived from activity
- Exit detected and classified
- Events normalized to AdapterEvent

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
