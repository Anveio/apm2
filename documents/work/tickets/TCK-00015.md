## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0003

Criteria:
- ShellExec runs commands in subprocess
- Commands checked against allowlist
- Timeout kills long-running commands
- Network access denied by default
- Output captured and hashed

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes

- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
