# Ticket: TCK-00013 — Define tool request/response contract

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00013
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Define ToolRequest protobuf messages
- Define ToolResponse protobuf messages
- Define tool types (FileRead, FileWrite, ShellExec, etc.)
- Implement request parsing and validation

Out of scope:
- Specific tool implementations (TCK-00014, 15, 16)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0004
- REQ-0012

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0008

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0008

Criteria:
- ToolRequest/ToolResponse protos defined
- All tool types covered
- Request validation rejects malformed input
- Fuzz tests for request parsing
- Documentation for tool contract

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
