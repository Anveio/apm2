# Ticket: TCK-00006 — Implement entropy budget tracker

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00006
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Define entropy budget configuration
- Track entropy consumption (errors, stalls, violations)
- Emit BudgetExceeded event
- Integrate with session lifecycle

Out of scope:
- Stall detection logic (TCK-00007)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0035
- REQ-0019

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0006
- EVID-0018

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0006
- EVID-0018

Criteria:
- Entropy budget configurable per session
- Entropy increments on errors and violations
- BudgetExceeded event emitted at threshold
- Session terminated when budget exceeded
- Budget visible in session_health projection

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
