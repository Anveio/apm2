# Ticket: TCK-00010 — Implement default-deny evaluation engine

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00010
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL, DOMAIN_SECURITY
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Evaluate tool requests against policy rules
- Default-deny if no rule matches
- Emit ToolDecided event with rule_id
- Track which rule matched

Out of scope:
- Budget enforcement (TCK-00011)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0004
- REQ-0005

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0003
- EVID-0013

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0003
- EVID-0013

Criteria:
- Default-deny for unmatched requests
- Allow rules grant specific permissions
- Deny rules override allow rules
- ToolDecided event includes rule_id
- Fuzz tests for policy evaluation

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
