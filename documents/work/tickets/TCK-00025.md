# Ticket: TCK-00025 — Implement seccomp sandbox for black-box adapter

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00025
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL, DOMAIN_SECURITY
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Define seccomp profile for agent processes
- Restrict syscalls to minimum required set
- Allow only mediated I/O paths

Out of scope:
- Other platform sandboxing (macOS, Windows)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0004

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0014

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0014

Criteria:
- Seccomp profile blocks direct network/filesystem syscalls
- Agent can only communicate via mediated channels
- Profile violations logged and session terminated

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- **OPTIONAL**: This ticket is part of the pre-production hardening phase and is not required for initial release.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
