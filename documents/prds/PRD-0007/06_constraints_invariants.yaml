      statement: CAC-JSON is the sole normative representation for control artifacts.
      rationale: |
        A single canonical format ensures deterministic parsing, validation, and hashing
        across all implementations. Derived formats (TOON, Markdown) are never authoritative.
      enforcement: Schema admission rejects non-CAC-JSON normative artifacts.

        - EVID-0001
    - id: CNS-0002
      statement: JSON numbers are restricted to integers within signed 64-bit range.
      rationale: |
        Avoids float parsing ambiguity across implementations. Non-integer values are
        represented as strings with explicit unit/type.
      enforcement: Canonicalizer rejects floating-point numbers; validator enforces range.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0001
    - id: CNS-0003
      statement: Maximum JSON depth is 128; maximum array length and object members are 100000.
      rationale: DoS resistance and predictable memory usage during parsing and validation.
      enforcement: Parser and validator enforce hard limits; violations rejected.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0002
    - id: CNS-0004
      statement: Duplicate object keys are forbidden.
      rationale: Ensures deterministic canonicalization and prevents ambiguous interpretation.
      enforcement: Parser rejects documents with duplicate keys.

    - id: CNS-0005
      statement: |
        String values MUST be UTF-8 encoded and NFC normalized. Canonicalizer MUST
        reject artifacts containing non-NFC strings. All string comparisons MUST
        normalize to NFC before comparison. NFD, NFKC, and NFKD representations
        MUST be rejected.
      rationale: |
        Ensures consistent string comparison and hash stability. Prevents Unicode
        normalization ambiguity attacks where semantically identical strings hash
        differently due to normalization form variance.
      enforcement: |
        Canonicalizer validates NFC normalization during canonicalization.
        Artifacts with non-NFC strings fail admission with UNICODE_NORMALIZATION_ERROR.

      statement: Bootstrap schema bundle is immutable via the standard patch pipeline.
      rationale: |
        Bootstrap trust root must be stable and verifiable. Updates require binary release,
        not runtime patches.
      enforcement: Admission rejects patches targeting bootstrap stable IDs.

      statement: All patch admissions require expected_base_hash matching current artifact state.

        Unit mismatches between referenced quantities MUST be rejected at validation.
        Arithmetic operations across quantities with different units MUST fail
        at compile time.
      rationale: Prevents unit mismatch errors that could cause silent failures in budget enforcement.

        Compilation SHOULD warn if author_identity is not on approved producer

      name: Dependency trust boundary protection
      type: preventative
      details: |
        Pack specs capture dependency_review_hash at review time. Compilation fails if
        resolved hash differs from reviewed hash, preventing timing-based injection where
        an adversary modifies stable_id content between review and compilation.

      name: Dependency hash drift auditing
      type: detective
      details: |
        DependencyHashDrift events emitted when compilation detects hash mismatch. Events
        include old_hash, new_hash, stable_id, and review_timestamp for investigation.

      name: AATReceipt binary binding
      type: preventative
      details: |
        AATReceipts MUST be cryptographically bound to binary hash. Required fields:
        binary_hash (BLAKE3-256 of apm2 binary), capability_manifest_hash, test_suite_version,
        execution_timestamp. Receipts for mismatched binaries are rejected.

      name: Content-hash-only fetch restriction
      type: preventative
      details: |
        Content-hash-only fetches are denied in consumption mode. All fetches
        MUST specify stable_id for policy enforcement. This prevents bypass
        of stable_id allowlist via content hash discovery through side channels.
