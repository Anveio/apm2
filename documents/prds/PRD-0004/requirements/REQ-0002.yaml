  title: Bounded holonic refinement passes
  statement: 'The system MUST refine PRDs through bounded holonic episodes. Each refinement pass executes within episode budget constraints (tokens, time, max_episodes) and produces typed patches and decisions. The supervisor holon coordinates passes in sequence: scope normalization, acceptance criteria, constraints, ambiguity detection, and coherence closure.'
  acceptance_criteria:
    - 'Command `apm2 plan refine <prd_id> --passes N` executes up to N refinement cycles.'
    - Each pass is a bounded holonic episode with configurable token/time limits.
    - Passes execute in defined order (scope → criteria → constraints → ambiguity → coherence).
    - Each pass emits PlanRefined event with pass_type, patches_hash, and decisions.
    - Pass execution respects entropy budget; exceeding budget triggers episode termination.
    - Refinement can be resumed from checkpoint if interrupted.
