  title: Operator gate override with rationale
  statement: 'Operators MUST be able to override gate decisions (e.g., force PASS on a failed gate) with required rationale. Overrides are auditable ledger events that enable learning about noisy gates and edge cases.'
  acceptance_criteria:
    - 'Command `apm2 intervene override <gate_run_id> --result PASS --reason "<rationale>"` overrides gate.'
    - Override event includes original result, new result, operator identity, and rationale.
    - Override does not delete original gate result; both are visible in timeline.
    - Overrides are signed and require operator authority role.
    - Override patterns can be analyzed to identify noisy or misconfigured gates.
    - No silent overrides; all overrides are auditable in ledger.
