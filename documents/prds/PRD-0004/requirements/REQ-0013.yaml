  title: Recurrence threshold triggers countermeasure work
  statement: 'When a finding signature recurs beyond a configurable threshold (default: 3 occurrences), the system MUST automatically create a countermeasure work item. This closes the feedback loop and prevents recurring issues from becoming technical debt.'
  acceptance_criteria:
    - RecurrenceReducer tracks finding occurrences by signature.
    - When signature count exceeds threshold, CountermeasureProposed event is emitted.
    - Countermeasure work item specifies finding signatures and suggested remediation type.
    - Remediation types include LINT_RULE, TEMPLATE_UPDATE, SAFE_API, POLICY_UPDATE, TEST_HARNESS.
    - Countermeasure creation is automatic; no human trigger required.
    - Threshold is configurable per finding category (security may have lower threshold).
