    This directory contains individual requirement files for the Forge Admission Cycle (FAC)
    PRD. Each requirement is stored in a separate YAML file following the prd_requirement
    schema. FAC governs the hardened promotion protocol from changeset ingestion through
    cryptographically-enforced admission to trunk, with projection-only GitHub sync.

  requirements:
    - id: "REQ-0001"
      title: "Mechanical Context Firewall"
      type: "SECURITY"
      file: "REQ-0001.yaml"
    - id: "REQ-0002"
      title: "Projection Divergence Emergency Stop"
      type: "SECURITY"
      file: "REQ-0002.yaml"
    - id: "REQ-0003"
      title: "CI evidence-backed readiness gating"
      type: "SECURITY"
      file: "REQ-0003.yaml"
    - id: "REQ-0004"
      title: "Typed GateReceipt payloads for AAT"
      type: "SECURITY"
      file: "REQ-0004.yaml"
    - id: "REQ-0005"
      title: "Gate outcome determinism envelope"
      type: "SECURITY"
      file: "REQ-0005.yaml"

  inherited_requirements:
    source_prd: "PRD-0004"
    requirements:
      - id: "REQ-0009"
        title: "Signed GateRunCompleted"
        rationale: "FAC relies on cryptographically signed gate outcomes for admission decisions"
      - id: "REQ-0015"
        title: "GitHub sync adapter projects ledger state"
        rationale: "FAC projection model requires adapter-only writes to GitHub"
      - id: "REQ-0025"
        title: "Critical Event Signing"
        rationale: "FAC admission authority requires signed events with chain-of-custody"
