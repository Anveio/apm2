  title: "CI evidence-backed readiness gating"
  statement: |
    If CI is used to transition work into READY_FOR_REVIEW, the transition MUST be backed
    by imported raw evidence digests and adapter attestation.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "No transition based only on 'success' conclusion. Verified by: Test that CI webhook with only conclusion='success' and no evidence import does not trigger READY_FOR_REVIEW transition."
    - "EvidencePublished entries exist for CI logs/artifacts and are referenced from transition rationale metadata. Verified by: Test that READY_FOR_REVIEW transition includes EvidencePublished events for workflow logs, test reports, and artifacts with CAS hashes."
    - "Webhook signature is verified before evidence import. Verified by: Test that CI events from webhooks without valid signature are rejected and do not trigger any evidence import."
    - "Raw log/artifact digests are imported into CAS. Verified by: Test that workflow logs (compressed), test reports/artifacts, and workflow metadata are stored in CAS with content hashes."
    - "Adapter attestation is signed and committed. Verified by: Test that CI import produces signed attestation from HOLON-GITHUB-ADAPTER including workflow_run_id and downloaded_artifact_hashes."
    - "Feature flags control CI gating behavior (fail-closed default). Verified by: Test that when CI_EVENTS_ENABLED=false, CI events are ignored; when CI_GATED_QUEUE_ENABLED=false, READY_FOR_REVIEW transitions do not require attested evidence."
