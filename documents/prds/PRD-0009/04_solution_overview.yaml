    overview: |
      FAC is the internal, cryptographically enforced admission protocol; reviewers and
      verifiers sign lease-bound outcomes; merges are proven by MergeReceipts; GitHub is
      a projection. APM2 CLI runs the PR inner loop as a hardened protocol: admission is
      impossible to spoof, and every decision is replayable from ledger+CAS under strict
      OCAP. The key insight is that external forges (GitHub) cannot be sources of truth;
      all admission decisions must be cryptographically signed, internally verified, and
      projected outward.
