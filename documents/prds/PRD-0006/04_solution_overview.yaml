    overview: |
      The 'Teammate' is a high-level Holon Cluster running on the APM2 Work Substrate. It treats the user's life as a 'Project' and their goals as 'Plans.' It leverages recursive self-improvement to optimize its own support protocols based on user feedback.
    key_components:
      - name: "Personal Life Ledger"
        description: "A private, encrypted version of the APM2 Event Ledger for personal tasks and interactions."
      - name: "Teammate Holon"
        description: "The primary agentic unit that maintains the user's 'Markov Blanket' and manages sub-holons for scheduling, research, and support."
      - name: "Theory-of-Mind Wrapper"
        description: "A specialized reasoning skill (Mode #56) that maintains a model of the user's preferences, emotional state, and long-term goals."
      - name: "Capability-Based Adapters"
        description: "Least-privilege interfaces to external digital tools (Google, Outlook, etc.) using the Holonic Sync Adapter protocol."

    Teammate adheres to 'Principia Holonica':
    1. **Axiom I (Boundary):** User privacy is the core boundary. Internal user state is ephemeral; only approved events enter the ledger.
    2. **Axiom IV (Resource Boundedness):** Scheduling is constrained by user-defined 'energy budgets' and 'time leases.'
    3. **Axiom V (Active Inference):** Teammate constantly predicts the user's next need and acts to minimize the gap between current state and user goals.
