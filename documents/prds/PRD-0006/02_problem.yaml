  problem_statement: |
    Modern digital life is fragmented across disconnected tools, leading to cognitive overload and 'decision fatigue.' Existing AI assistants are reactive, lack emotional context, and cannot autonomously manage complex, multi-step life tasks (e.g., proactive scheduling and personalized support).
  target_audience:
    - name: "Knowledge Workers"
      pain_points: ["Over-scheduling", "Task fragmentation", "Lack of proactive support"]
    - name: "Prosumers"
      pain_points: ["Complex digital toolsets", "Need for integrated personal automation"]
  market_opportunity: |
    There is a void in the market for a 'Teammate'—an AI that transcends the 'chatbot' interface to become a durable companion that manages life tasks with the same autonomy and verification used in high-assurance software engineering.
