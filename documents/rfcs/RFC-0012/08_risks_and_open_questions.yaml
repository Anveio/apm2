      title: "Session spawn latency causes coordination timeout"
      description: |
        Session spawn involves process creation, environment setup, and
        initial handshake. This latency counts against max_duration_ms.
        If spawn latency is high, coordinations may timeout before
        useful work is done.
      likelihood: MEDIUM
      impact: MEDIUM
      mitigation:
        - "Track spawn latency separately in receipt for analysis"
        - "Provide budget sizing guidance based on observed latencies"
        - "Consider excluding spawn time from duration budget in future version"

      title: "Race condition between freshness check and session spawn"
      description: |
        Work state may change between the freshness check and actual
        session spawn, leading to duplicate execution or wasted resources.
      likelihood: LOW
      impact: LOW
      mitigation:
        - "Use ledger sequence number for consistent state view"
        - "Session validates work state at start, fails fast if stale"
        - "Coordination handles session failure gracefully"
      residual_risk: LOW

      title: "Circuit breaker triggers on transient failures"
      description: |
        Transient issues (network glitch, temporary API unavailability)
        may cause consecutive failures that trigger the circuit breaker,
        aborting a coordination that could have recovered.
      likelihood: MEDIUM
      impact: MEDIUM
      mitigation:
        - "Threshold of 3 balances safety vs availability (per tradeoff analysis)"
        - "Document that circuit breaker is safety feature, not nuisance"
        - "Consider exponential backoff between retries in future version"

      title: "Serial execution limits throughput"
      description: |
        MVP processes one work item at a time. For large work queues,
        this may result in long coordination durations that hit
        time-based budget limits.
      likelihood: HIGH
      impact: LOW
      mitigation:
        - "Serial execution is MVP scope; parallel is Phase 2"
        - "Operators can run multiple coordinations for independent work"
        - "Document throughput expectations"

    - risk_id: RISK-COORD-005
      title: "Budget estimation is difficult without historical data"
      description: |
        Operators may over-provision (waste) or under-provision
        (premature termination) budgets without good defaults or
        historical guidance.
      likelihood: HIGH
      impact: MEDIUM
      mitigation:
        - "Collect budget usage data from early coordinations"
        - "Provide budget recommendation in documentation"
        - "Receipt includes budget_usage for post-hoc analysis"

  open_questions:
    - question_id: OQ-COORD-001
      question: "How should controller integrate with existing SessionReducer spawn flow?"
      context: |
        SessionReducer has an existing session spawn mechanism. Coordination
        needs to spawn sessions and observe their outcomes. Need to understand
        the exact integration points.
      v0_status: UNKNOWN
      discovery_actions:
        - "Review SessionReducer spawn implementation in v2 phase"
        - "Identify event sequences for session lifecycle"
        - "Determine if new events are needed or existing suffice"
      owner: AUTH_ARCHITECTURE

    - question_id: OQ-COORD-002
      question: "What is the checkpoint format for CoordinationReducer?"
      context: |
        Checkpointing enables efficient state recovery without full replay.
        Need to define checkpoint structure compatible with existing
        checkpoint infrastructure.
      v0_status: UNKNOWN
      discovery_actions:
        - "Review existing checkpoint patterns (SessionReducer, WorkReducer)"
        - "Define CoordinationCheckpoint structure"
        - "Implement checkpoint save/restore"
      owner: AUTH_ARCHITECTURE

    - question_id: OQ-COORD-003
      question: "How does coordination interact with work item state transitions?"
      context: |
        Work items have state (open, in_progress, completed). Coordination
        needs to understand when work is eligible for processing and when
        to mark it complete. Does coordination emit work state events or
        just observe them?
      v0_status: UNKNOWN
      discovery_actions:
        - "Review WorkReducer state machine"
        - "Determine work eligibility criteria"
        - "Clarify responsibility for work state transitions"
      owner: AUTH_ARCHITECTURE

    - question_id: OQ-COORD-004
      question: "Should circuit breaker threshold be configurable?"
      context: |
        PRD-0008 specifies fixed threshold of 3. Some work types may
        benefit from higher or lower thresholds.
      v0_status: DEFERRED
      proposed_answer: |
        Start with fixed threshold for simplicity. Make configurable
        if operators demonstrate need based on work type.

    - question_id: OQ-COORD-005
      question: "How should coordination handle work items that become invalid mid-execution?"
      context: |
        Work item may be deleted or blocked while coordination is running.
        What should coordination do?
      v0_status: DEFERRED
      proposed_answer: |
        Work freshness check catches most cases. For mid-coordination
        invalidation, session will fail and coordination proceeds.
        Document as expected behavior.

  deferred_items:
    - item_id: DEFER-COORD-001
      title: "Parallel agent execution"
      reason: |
        Parallel execution adds complexity around resource contention,
        failure isolation, and budget allocation. Deferred to Phase 2.

    - item_id: DEFER-COORD-002
      title: "Coordination pause/resume functionality"
      reason: |
        Pause/resume adds state complexity and partial receipt handling.
        Not needed for MVP autonomous operation.

    - item_id: DEFER-COORD-003
      title: "Dynamic priority reordering during execution"
      reason: |
        MVP processes queue in initial order. Dynamic reordering adds
        complexity without clear benefit for Phase 1 goals.

    - item_id: DEFER-COORD-004
      title: "Human notification hooks"
      reason: |
        MVP emits events and receipts; external systems can subscribe.
        Built-in notification deferred.
