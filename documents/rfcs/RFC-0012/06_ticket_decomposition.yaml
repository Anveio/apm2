    This file is a placeholder for v0 (Discovery phase).
    Ticket decomposition will be populated in v4 (Standard phase) after:
    - v2 (Exploration): Codebase investigation grounds design decisions
    - v4 (Closure): All open questions resolved or deferred

    overview: |
      Based on PRD-0008 requirements and phased rollout, expect approximately
      6-8 tickets covering:
      - Coordination reducer and state types (REQ-COORD-0001)
      - Coordination events schema (REQ-COORD-0002)
      - Budget enforcement (REQ-COORD-0003)
      - Serial execution loop (REQ-COORD-0004)
      - Stop conditions and circuit breaker (REQ-COORD-0005)
      - CLI command implementation (REQ-COORD-0006)
      - Evidence receipt builder (REQ-COORD-0007)
      - Integration tests and documentation
