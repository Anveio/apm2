    prd_ref: "documents/prds/PRD-0008/04_solution_overview.yaml#prd_solution_overview"
    options:
      - option_id: OPT-A
        name: "External orchestrator (Airflow, Temporal)"
        description: |
          Use an external workflow orchestrator to manage APM2 sessions.
          The orchestrator spawns sessions, monitors outcomes, and enforces policies.
        evaluation:
          strengths:
            - "Mature tools with built-in retry, timeout, and monitoring"
            - "Separates orchestration concerns from APM2 core"
          weaknesses:
            - "Splits state across systems; loses ledger provenance"
            - "Adds operational complexity and external dependency"
            - "Coordination policies not grounded in same ledger as work/session state"

      - option_id: OPT-B
        name: "Native coordination reducer (event-sourced)"
        description: |
          Implement CoordinationReducer as a native event-sourced projection.
          Coordination events are recorded in the same ledger as work/session events.
          Controller spawns sessions and emits coordination events in a serial loop.
        evaluation:
          strengths:
            - "Single source of truth in the ledger"
            - "Coordination state is deterministically reconstructable"
            - "Follows established reducer patterns (SessionReducer, WorkReducer)"
            - "No external dependencies"
          weaknesses:
            - "Additional complexity in core crate"
            - "Serial execution in MVP limits throughput"

      - option_id: OPT-C
        name: "Cron-based session spawning"
        description: |
          Use cron jobs to periodically spawn sessions for pending work items.
          Simplest approach with minimal coordination logic.
        evaluation:
          strengths:
            - "Very simple to implement"
            - "No runtime coordination state"
          weaknesses:
            - "Inflexible; cannot respond to dynamic work queues"
            - "No budget enforcement across sessions"
            - "No circuit breaker protection"
            - "Race conditions without freshness checks"

    selected_approach:
      choice: OPT-B
      rationale: |
        PRD-0008 specifies that coordination must integrate with existing reducer
        infrastructure and maintain ledger provenance. OPT-B (native reducer) provides:
        - Single source of truth for all state
        - Deterministic replay and checkpointing
        - Budget enforcement grounded in ledger events
        - Circuit breaker with consistent state across restarts

        OPT-A (external orchestrator) was rejected because it splits state across
        systems and loses the audit trail benefits of event sourcing.

        OPT-C (cron) was rejected because it lacks budget enforcement and circuit
        breaker protection required by PRD-0008.

  architecture_decisions:
    - decision_id: AD-COORD-001
      title: "New coordination module in apm2-core"
      description: |
        Create crates/apm2-core/src/coordination/ module containing:
        - reducer.rs: CoordinationReducer implementing event-sourced projection
        - state.rs: CoordinationState structure and types
        - events.rs: Coordination event payloads
        - controller.rs: CoordinationController implementing serial execution loop
        - evidence.rs: CoordinationReceipt builder
      rationale: |
        Following established patterns of session/ and work/ modules.
        Coordination is a peer reducer, not a wrapper around existing reducers.
      impact_map_ref: "evidence/prd/PRD-0008/impact_map/impact_map.yaml"
      net_new_justification: |
        No existing coordination infrastructure. This is net-new but follows
        established reducer patterns. Module is well-scoped with clear boundaries.

    - decision_id: AD-COORD-002
      title: "Coordination does NOT modify other reducer states"
      description: |
        CoordinationReducer observes events from Work/Session/Lease reducers.
        It emits coordination-specific events but never directly modifies
        work items, sessions, or leases.
      rationale: |
        Separation of concerns: each reducer owns its projection.
        This preserves reducer invariants and enables independent evolution.
        Coordination reacts to state changes; it doesn't cause them.

    - decision_id: AD-COORD-003
      title: "Binding events bracket session lifecycle"
      description: |
        coordination.session_bound MUST be emitted before session.started.
        coordination.session_unbound MUST be emitted after session.terminated.
        This ensures complete binding lifecycle tracking.
      rationale: |
        Binding events provide correlation between work items and sessions.
        Bracketing ensures no orphan bindings (INV-COORD-0002).

    - decision_id: AD-COORD-004
      title: "Mandatory budget parameters"
      description: |
        max_episodes and max_duration_ms are required for every coordination.
        max_tokens is optional but recommended.
        Budget exhaustion terminates coordination gracefully.
      rationale: |
        No coordination can run indefinitely (safety invariant).
        Mandatory budgets prevent resource exhaustion without operator configuration.
      constraint_ref: "documents/prds/PRD-0008/06_constraints_invariants.yaml#CNS-COORD-0002"

    - decision_id: AD-COORD-005
      title: "Circuit breaker threshold of 3 consecutive failures"
      description: |
        Coordination aborts after 3 consecutive session failures.
        Counter resets to 0 on any successful session completion.
      rationale: |
        Based on PRD-0008 tradeoff analysis (TRADEOFF-COORD-0001).
        3 failures indicates systematic issue, not transient failure.
        Reset on success allows recovery from temporary issues.
      tradeoff_ref: "documents/prds/PRD-0008/08_risks_questions.yaml#TRADEOFF-COORD-0001"

    - decision_id: AD-COORD-006
      title: "Work freshness check using ledger sequence"
      description: |
        Before spawning a session, controller checks work state at a known
        ledger event sequence number. Spawn proceeds only if work is still
        in eligible state at that sequence.
      rationale: |
        Event ordering provides consistent view across reducers.
        Prevents race conditions where work state changes during spawn.

  v0_discovery_notes: |
    This is RFC v0 (Discovery phase). Design decisions are initial hypotheses.

    - Verify reducer pattern compatibility with existing reducers
    - Identify specific integration points in SessionReducer/WorkReducer
    - Validate CAS storage patterns for receipt artifacts
    - Confirm CLI extension patterns for apm2 coordinate command
