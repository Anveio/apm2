  risks:
  - id: RSK-RFC-3001
    statement: |
      The Holon trait's associated types may be too restrictive, preventing
      some use cases or requiring awkward workarounds.
    impact: "Medium: Limits framework applicability"
    likelihood: "Low: Design based on concrete use cases"
    mitigations:
    - "Design from concrete skill requirements"
    - "Provide escape hatches via Any types if needed"
    - "Plan for trait evolution in minor versions"
    - "Gather feedback from early implementations"
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-3001

  - id: RSK-RFC-3002
    statement: |
      Stop condition predicates may be expensive to evaluate, impacting
      episode latency especially with complex goal specifications.
    impact: "Medium: Performance degradation"
    likelihood: "Medium: Depends on predicate complexity"
    mitigations:
    - "Profile predicate evaluation in benchmarks"
    - "Cache predicate results where safe"
    - "Provide guidelines for predicate design"
    - "Support early termination for simple cases"
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-3002

  - id: RSK-RFC-3003
    statement: |
      Lease derivation for sub-holons may create complex authority chains
      that are difficult to audit or debug.
    impact: "Medium: Operational complexity"
    likelihood: "Medium: Hierarchical delegation is inherently complex"
    mitigations:
    - "Limit derivation depth via policy"
    - "Require explicit derivation justification"
    - "Provide lease chain visualization tooling"
    - "Log all derivation events"
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-3004

  - id: RSK-RFC-3004
    statement: |
      Event-sourced state may grow unboundedly for long-running work,
      impacting replay time and storage requirements.
    impact: "Medium: Storage and performance"
    likelihood: "Medium: Long-running work is expected"
    mitigations:
    - "Implement work archival for completed work"
    - "Checkpoint projections to reduce replay"
    - "Set work duration limits via budget"
    - "Monitor event growth rate"
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-3002

  - id: RSK-RFC-3005
    statement: |
      Integration with RFC-0001 kernel may reveal design mismatches,
      requiring significant rework of the holonic framework.
    impact: "High: Rework cost"
    likelihood: "Low to Medium: Designed with kernel in mind"
    mitigations:
    - "Early integration testing with kernel stubs"
    - "Co-design review with RFC-0001 authors"
    - "Maintain clear interface boundaries"
    - "Version traits for evolution"

  open_questions:
  - id: Q-RFC-3001
    question: |
      Should the Holon trait support async execution natively, or should
      async be handled at the adapter/orchestration level?
    decision_needed_by: "2026-02-15"
    resolution_plan: |
      Implement synchronous trait first. Add async_trait wrapper if
      needed based on integration experience. Async at orchestration
      level provides more flexibility initially.

  - id: Q-RFC-3002
    question: |
      How should the framework handle holons that spawn many sub-holons?
      Should there be a default fanout limit?
    decision_needed_by: "2026-02-15"
    resolution_plan: |
      Implement configurable fanout limit in lease scope. Default to
      conservative limit (e.g., 5). Monitor actual usage patterns
      during integration testing.

  - id: Q-RFC-3003
    question: |
      Should evidence artifacts be typed more strongly, or remain as
      generic serde_json::Value payloads?
    decision_needed_by: "2026-02-10"
    resolution_plan: |
      Start with category-based typing (e.g., TestResult, ReviewOutcome).
      Add stronger typing if patterns emerge. Generic fallback for
      custom evidence types.

  - id: Q-RFC-3004
    question: |
      How should the framework handle circular dependencies between
      work items or holons?
    decision_needed_by: "2026-02-20"
    resolution_plan: |
      Prohibit circular work dependencies by validating DAG structure
      on work creation. For runtime circular escalation, implement
      cycle detection with automatic escalation to common ancestor.
