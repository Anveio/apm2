      Validates that the holonic framework architecture aligns with
      Principia Holonica axioms and integrates cleanly with RFC-0001 kernel.
    checklist:
    - "Holon trait embodies Axiom I (Markov Blanket)"
    - "Event sourcing embodies Axiom II (Ledger of Truth)"
    - "Sub-holon spawning embodies Axiom III (Recursive Structure)"
    - "Lease/Budget embodies Axiom IV (Resource Boundedness)"
    - "Episode loop embodies Axiom V (Active Inference)"
    - "Channel typing embodies Axiom VI (Selective Permeability)"
    - "Integration with RFC-0001 ledger is clean"

      Validates that the framework handles failure modes gracefully and
      maintains consistency under various conditions.
    checklist:
    - "Work lifecycle state machine is correct"
    - "Lease expiration handled gracefully"
    - "Budget exhaustion terminates cleanly"
    - "Event chain integrity verified"
    - "Escalation propagates correctly"
    - "Property tests pass"
