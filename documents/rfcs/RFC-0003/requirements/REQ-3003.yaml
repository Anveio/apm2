  title: "Structured work objects with lifecycle state machine"
  statement: |
    The framework MUST implement first-class work objects that:
    - Have stable identifiers (WorkId) persisting across restarts
    - Track lifecycle states: Pending, InProgress, Blocked, Completed, Failed, Escalated
    - Bind to requirement identifiers for traceability
    - Reference produced artifacts for evidence
    - Record execution attempt history with episode provenance
    - Validate state transitions and reject invalid transitions
  acceptance_criteria:
  - WorkObject struct contains all specified fields.
  - All lifecycle states are represented in WorkLifecycle enum.
  - State transition validation rejects invalid transitions.
  - Completed and Failed are terminal states.
  - AttemptRecord captures episode history per attempt.
  - Property tests verify state machine correctness.

    notes:
    - "Validated by state machine property tests"
    - "Supports traceable refinement per holonic work tracking"
