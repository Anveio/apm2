  title: "Holon contract surface via trait"
  statement: |
    The framework MUST define a Holon trait that specifies the contract surface
    for any agent participating in holonic coordination. The trait MUST include:
    - Associated types for Input, Output, and State
    - intake() method for work request handling with lease validation
    - execute_episode() method for bounded execution within context
    - emit_artifact() method for producing evidence to the ledger
    - escalate() method for propagating work to supervisor
    - should_stop() method for evaluating stop conditions
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Holon trait is defined with all specified methods and associated types.
  - Associated types are constrained with Send + Sync bounds for concurrency safety.
  - A reference implementation (MockHolon) demonstrates correct trait usage.
  - Trait methods are documented with usage examples.
  - Compile-time errors are produced for incorrect trait implementations.
