      title: "Session dispatcher wiring strategy"
      statement: "SessionDispatcher will be constructed with full dependencies (CAS, ledger, clock, broker) via a new with_full_context method, preserving with_persistence for tests"
      context: |
        The current with_persistence method constructs SessionDispatcher without CAS, ledger, clock, or broker.
        We need to enable real tool execution and event persistence without breaking existing tests.

      statement: "Use Option B: store ToolResultData individually AND a compact ToolLogIndex artifact listing all hashes for the session"
      context: |
        Tool execution stores results to CAS but doesn't surface hashes for receipts.
        We need to decide between per-result hashes only vs. per-result + index.
