  title: "Structured error types with rationale codes"
  statement: |
    All kernel errors MUST use structured error types with machine-readable
    rationale codes that map to documented failure modes and recovery actions.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Error types derive thiserror::Error with structured variants.
  - Each error variant includes a rationale_code field (e.g., ERR_POLICY_DENY).
  - Error codes are documented in a central error registry.
  - CLI output includes rationale codes in machine-readable format.
