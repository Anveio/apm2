  title: "Async-first architecture with Tokio runtime"
  statement: |
    The kernel MUST use Tokio as the async runtime and structure all I/O-bound
    operations (syscall mediation, adapter communication, ledger writes) as
    async tasks with proper cancellation and timeout handling.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - All public async functions accept CancellationToken or equivalent.
  - Timeout enforcement uses tokio::time::timeout or similar.
  - No blocking I/O on the async runtime (spawn_blocking for necessary cases).
  - Graceful shutdown propagates cancellation to all active tasks.
