  title: "Kernel module isolation and dependency injection"
  statement: |
    The kernel MUST be structured as isolated modules (Supervisor, Ledger,
    PolicyEngine, Reducers, Adapters) with explicit interfaces and dependency
    injection to enable independent testing and future replacement.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Each module is defined in a separate Rust module with a public trait interface.
  - Module implementations receive dependencies via constructor injection.
  - Unit tests can instantiate modules with mock dependencies.
  - No module directly instantiates another module's concrete type.
