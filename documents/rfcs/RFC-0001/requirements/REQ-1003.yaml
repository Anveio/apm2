  title: "Deterministic test harness with simulated time"
  statement: |
    The kernel MUST support a test mode where time is simulated, allowing
    deterministic replay of timeout and scheduling scenarios without wall-clock
    delays.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - A Clock trait abstracts time operations (now, sleep, timeout).
  - Test harness provides SimulatedClock that advances on demand.
  - Timeout and lease expiration tests complete in milliseconds, not real time.
  - Reducer replay tests use deterministic event ordering.

    notes:
