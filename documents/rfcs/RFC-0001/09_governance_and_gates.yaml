      Validates that the kernel architecture aligns with PRD requirements
      and follows sound engineering principles.
    checklist:
    - "Module boundaries are well-defined"
    - "Trait interfaces enable testing and replacement"
    - "Event schema supports evolution"

    description: |
      Validates that the kernel implements default-deny security, protects
      trust boundaries, and handles cryptographic operations correctly.
    checklist:
    - "Default-deny enforced for all tool requests"
    - "Trust boundaries documented and enforced"
    - "Cryptographic keys properly managed"
    - "Audit trail complete and tamper-evident"
    - "No known bypass vulnerabilities"

    description: |
      Validates that the kernel handles failures gracefully, recovers
      deterministically, and maintains consistency.
    checklist:
    - "Session crash recovery works correctly"
    - "Ledger corruption detected"
    - "Reducers are deterministic"
    - "Lease conflicts resolved correctly"

    rationale: |
      Federation and multi-node partition tolerance (REQ-0020, REQ-0021, REQ-0037)
      are partially implemented via lease mechanics. Full implementation including
      QUIC federation and canonical root selection is deferred to RFC-0002.
