  verdict: PASSED
  verdict_reason: |
    All gates passed. Council reached unanimous quorum on 7/9 findings and majority quorum on 2/9.
    All MAJOR findings have been remediated. Remaining MINOR findings are either REMEDIATED or
    appropriately DEFERRED/ACCEPTED. PRD-0005 strongly aligns with Phase 1 (Recursive Self-Improvement)
    of the North Star vision.

  updated_verdict: PASSED
  updated_verdict_reason: |
    After incorporating SA-2 findings:
    - 6 additional MAJOR findings identified
    - 3 MAJOR findings remediated directly (FND-SA2-C1-002, -006, -009)
    - 3 MAJOR findings acknowledged for implementation phase (FND-SA2-C1-001, -003, -004)
    - All blocking issues addressed with either remediations or explicit implementation guidance
    - PRD now includes promote safety requirements, dirty tree constraints, and anti-gaming measures
    - PRD-0005 maintains strong Phase 1 alignment with improved operational robustness
