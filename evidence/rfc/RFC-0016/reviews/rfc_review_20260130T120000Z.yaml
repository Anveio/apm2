verdict: APPROVED
verdict_reason: |
  All 9 gates passed. Zero BLOCKER findings. Zero MAJOR findings.

  Previous MAJOR findings have been remediated:
  - FND-RFC-0016-002: TCK-00240 HolonicClock now has detailed implementation steps
  - FND-RFC-0016-003: TCK-00244 now specifies concrete file paths

  RFC-0016 (Holonic Time Fabric) is well-designed with:
  - Sound four-clock authority model (L, M, C, W)
  - Comprehensive security threat model with fail-closed policies
  - Anti-cousin compliant type design
  - Clear implementation paths for all 12 tickets

  Ready for ticket emission and v2 advancement.
